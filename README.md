# home-server

Hi, I think it's time I start sharing all the scripts I've written for my server/home setup. Not sure how the format is going to be but better to start somewhere right?


Some background on why this repo is called home-server but actually has non server stuff: my "desktop" is actually a virtualized Ubuntu install running on a Proxmox hypervisor along side 10ish other VMs, so everything here kinda falls under that. I might rename it later but here we are for now.
